I've been participating in Game Jams lately. If you do not know what that is: teams get together for a weekend or so to compete making a game around a theme. Sort of like a hackathon. Here are a few of the projects I've participated in.

*Heavy is the Hand* is a Tarot (or Tarot-ish, rather) card reading puzzle game. The king has gone mad and has decreed that any and all decisions must be left to fate. You, oracle, deal a set of three cards -past, present, and future- to an individual who's being tried for a crime. With your tome, and considering the circumstantial nature of the reading, you should be able to deliver an accurate interpretation of what fate the individual carries. Interpret the meaning of the cards in front of you, and let the gods whisper onto you.

My role here was primarily back-end programming, and driving a narrative via writing and building encounters. I made sure we could have a very streamlined process to creating encounters so that we could avoid redundancy and make the process of creating a scenario a very simple one. 

Additionally, these encounters and the events that transpired therein needed some *bite*, which I believe I was able to provide. Seeing people reach the conclusions with the information I'd laid out with both the readings and the dialogue in place was a nice sight. 

I loved the theme here. Abstract and charged. It let us have a lot of creative interpretations, so the ideation process was bountiful. We were heavily inspired by *[Inscryption](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/)* and *[Papers,  Please](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/)*.

*Finite Monkey Theorem* is a teleprompter management game. You play the role of Murphy: a monkey in charge of telling a crowd how to react to the mishaps in the talkshow "*Saturday Night with Atmos*". People on stage have a tendency to go off-script. *Nassion* does **not** like that. Will Murphy play along with Nassion's demands and entertain Geordie Atmos' (voiced by yours truly) lukewarm jokes? 

I mostly took the role of writer and level designer for this project. The game's main content and decision making lies is the dissonance between its script and audible dialogue. I felt capable of giving the dialogue and script enough substance to make it interesting to hear and maybe crack a few smiles here and there. 

With that came the challenge of allowing this dialogue to have the correct pacing and bait-and-switch events to make it enticing to play as the one giving audience cues, and being graded for them. Guessing games and ambiguity of expected crowd reactions had to be introduced as well. Therein lied, after all, the level design of this game as well.

Level design was done via Audacity labels to denote adequacy, inadequacy, or revelry of reactions. I also helped optimizing the back-end logic programming of importing labeling as playable records.

*Possessed Possessions in a Bag* is an eerie, bite-sized stealth puzzle game with a red-light-green-light thematic. It follows a soul trapped in a bag, which resides inside a bag, which resides inside a- you get the idea. This soul is capable of possessing other objects in the bag. The player can use this to their advantage, both in movement and stealth. 

Its artstyle was heavily inspired by the *[FAITH](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1179080/FAITH_The_Unholy_Trinity/)* series. I decided to take the role of Art direction for this project to be able to carry out said style into the end product, which ended up awarding us Best Graphics.
