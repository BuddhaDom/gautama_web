[*Paradox Clue*](https://edneedsbread.itch.io/paradox-clue) is a game developed for the 2024 [Game Development Project course at University of Gothemburg](https://www.gu.se/en/study-gothenburg/game-design-technology-masters-programme-n2gdt). 

The theme for this project was Public Domain, and for such, we had to choose a piece of publicly owned media to make a game out of. We chose two: *The Starry Night*, by Vincent Van Gogh, and *Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde* by Robert Louis Stevenson.

The game consists of two levels that are meant to play a back-and-forth of creating a hypothesis, and acting out how a scenario might have happened. This constantly cause paradoxes to occur where you might have reached a place before you even opened the door to that location, which was part of the almost deliriant spirit that we strived to achieve.

Developed with **Godot** version 4.3.

## The Setting

Paradox Clue is a game about an investigation into the strange disappearance of *The Starry Night*. 

Set in 1940s Blackmord, detective Jackal is on the hunt for The Hound, prime suspect to the investigation, and his perpetual tormentor. Think like a culprit would, and swap shoes between these two characters to find out how exactly did he get away with such bold a crime. 

## Contributions

### Swapping and Transitions

A lot of the game depended on being able to toggle on and off between modes by selecting the correct things to swap between in each mode, and seamlessly trigger a transition between the two. I worked on swapping components to make the transition between modes possible, and also gave them good looking transitions for when specific things happen.

### Graphics

One of the things we settled on from the very start was that while it is true that you play two characters, each character sees people in a different way. 

Detective Jackal sees people as two-dimensional. Flat personalities, but, nevertheless, people. So I made sure to try to express said frame of mind via a set of two billboards, one locked to the Y axis, and one always facing the player. That way, while these characters were motionless, they still felt like they had some manner of life to them, with eyes that followed you around in the scene.

The Hound, however, sees people as nothing more than obstacles. They're danger where they stand, and must be avoided at all costs. I worked on a shader that would help express this frame of mind. While characters remain static, their outlines are uneasy and erratic. They spell out caution visually, forces to be reckoned, and avoided. While humans do catch you red-handed, animals don't care for the Hound's presence, and remain unbothered. So while they share the same shader properties, its a much calmer view for them.

### Narrative

I did a good deal of dialogue for this game. I wanted to retain the themes reminiscent of film noir, while introducing our bizzarre and at times absurdist commentary sprinkled throughout conversations and introspections. 

Dialogue was sprinkled throughout the game, across NPC conversations and flavor text through intractable objects in the scene. Here's a snippet that I liked about detective Jackal pulling a random book from a bookshelf.
