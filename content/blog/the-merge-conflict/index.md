# "Rollback spacetime."

<!--more-->

We worked on this game as a group of three for the *Open Project in Interaction Design* course at Gothenburg University over the course of 8 weeks. For this project, our design challenge was to avoid using virtual locomotion systems, and to bend space as much as possible. For such, we resorted to heavy use of stationary portals as a means of attaining [redirected walking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirected_walking). 

The entirety of the game, amassing to 1-2 hours of gameplay, takes place in a 4x4m square. According to position data, players walked an average of 1km per hour of playtime approximately, all within that area. Much to our surprise, players rarely felt cramped. Even more surprising, they reported a really good sense of direction. Even if the virtual space was impossible, it was easy to navigate and find your way around.

Developed with **Unity** version 2022.3.21f1.

Based on [*Portal Rendering and Creation Interactions in Virtual Reality*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9995211).

# Setting

The player is an Intern Developer in the company in charge of maintaining imperative reality. Including but not limited to laws of physics, spacetime, scale, perception, and so on. Unfortunately, someone else in the company has pushed a broken build onto production, which has caused large scale problems. Namely, time, scale, and perception are completely broken. Lucky for the company and for you, however, you happened to have a working build available on your system, which means you're the only person currently holding a tangible form. This means it is up to you to manually roll back changes in hopes to reestablish stable reality.

# The Game

The game is meant to be an escape room. Our sense of interpretation of this notion was that the player was, indeed, trapped in an impossible space, and that the urgency of the matter compelled them to do what's necessary to return to normalcy. Since this was (at least in intention) a vertical slice, we decided to have three separate "branches" each with a particular theme, and have these be three challenges that they'd be required to complete in order to proceed in their search. This would also allow us to better separate work as a team. 

## Perspective

This is the branch I worked on. I wanted to play around with viewing angles to solve puzzles, so I made a lot of the level design dependent on viewing objects through specific angles or in specific ways in order to progress.

The branch itself was very open ended, as in you could decide which of the present puzzles to solve first. I took heavy inspiration in an unnamed painting by Zdzisław Beksiński, which showed a really good opportunity to make use of static portals to show several environments at once.

## Time

The time branch had a lot of its design dedicated to performing different actions in different phases. The player would arrive at reception at a time where they couldn't get their keycard yet. To manipulate time, they made use of "the infinite hallway", which would advance time the more you walked into it. The hallway was a square-shaped three-sided path with no end, up until the player decided to turn back, at which point the exit would just be or or two corners away.

## Scale

The scale branch had a set of more experimental puzzles along with the big theme attached to it. Players were able to size themselves up and down through various means after exploring the area enough, allowing them to enter scale models present in the room. For instance, players could see a model sized spaceship sitting on a desk in one room, but visit the inside of the spaceship itself form another. The video above this shows the inside of the spaceship, and the image below shows it laying on a table. Also pictured within the spaceship is the room containing the key, which is accessible as a normal sized person as well.
